Bitcoin fees are implicit: fee = sum(inputs) − sum(outputs). Miners prioritize by fee rate (sats per vbyte), not transaction value. Transaction size depends on inputs/outputs and witness data; SegWit discounts witness weight. Fee estimates are policy/market-driven and can differ by node/mempool state. RBF lets you replace your own unconfirmed tx with a higher-fee version; CPFP lets a child spend an unconfirmed output to raise the effective package fee. Zero-fee can be valid by consensus but often won’t relay.
