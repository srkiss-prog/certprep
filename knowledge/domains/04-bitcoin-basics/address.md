# Overview

Keys control spending; addresses help you receive. A private key is secret and used to sign; a public key is shared and used to verify. Bitcoin doesn’t store coins “in an address”—it tracks UTXOs locked by scripts; an address is a human-friendly encoding that helps create a locking

# Bitcoin Address Construction (Legacy P2PKH)

A Bitcoin address is generated by hashing the public key with SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160, prepending a version byte, appending a four-byte double-SHA-256 checksum, and encoding the result using Base58Check.

Step-by-step (precise)

1. Hash the public key

pubKeyHash = RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubkey))

2. Create the payload

payload = version_byte || pubKeyHash

3. Compute the checksum

checksum = first_4_bytes(
SHA256(SHA256(payload))
)

4. Encode

address = Base58Encode(payload || checksum)
