# CBP Practice Queue

This file is the single source of truth for **what to study next**.
It functions as a lightweight Kanban board for CBP preparation.

Rules:

- Items in **Next Up** are candidates for the next drill generation.
- Move items to **In Progress** only when actively drilling them.
- Move items to **Covered** once at least one speed-recognition drill exists.
- Re-add items to **Revisit** if traps or hesitation recur.
- Do NOT track scores here.
